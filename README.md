# KivyScoreBord
Something I used for a party

This was made with Kivy. In order to run the program you must have Kivy installed. the pythong file also has all imports needed
Beer_Games2.py is the main python file
beerGames.kv is the main kivy file
Please put these files in the same folder

the music and jpeg files are optional for how the program looks at sounds but are not needed for programs function. if you choose to use them, make sure they are in the same folder as the py and kv files. If they are not used, they will need to be deleted from the python program
